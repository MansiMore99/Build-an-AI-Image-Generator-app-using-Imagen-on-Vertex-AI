### Project Overview:

Generative AI on **Vertex AI **(also known as genAI or gen AI) gives you access to Google's large generative AI models so you can test, tune, and deploy them for use in your AI-powered applications. In this lab, you will:

- **Connect to Vertex AI (Google Cloud AI platform):** Learn how to establish a connection to Google's AI services using the Vertex AI SDK.
- **Load a pre-trained Image Generation Model:** Discover how to use a powerful, pre-trained AI model without building one from scratch.
- **Send text to the AI model:** Understand how to provide input for the AI to process.
- **Extract image-based answers from the AI:** Learn to handle and interpret the image responses generated by the AI model.
- **Understand the basics of building AI applications:** Gain insights into the core concepts of integrating AI into software projects.

Steps:

step 1:
Clone the repo Open the new file in Code editor. 

step2:
Copy the provided code snippet into your file.

step 3:
Click File > Save, enter GenerateImage.py for the Name field and click Save.

step 4:
Execute the Python file by clicking the triangle icon on the Code Editor or by invoking the below command inside the terminal within the Code Editor pane. This will generate a image file with name image.jpeg.
```
/usr/bin/python3 /GenerateImage.py
```
step 5:
Now to view the generated image, Click EXPLORER > image.jpeg

### Explanation:

- The code snippet is loading a pre-trained AI model called ImageGenerationModel (imagen-3.0-generate-002) on Vertex AI.
- The code calls the generate_image method of the loaded Gemini model.
- The input to the method is a text prompt.
- The code uses Gemini's ability to understand the text prompt and use it to build an AI Image.


Try it yourself! Experiment with different prompts to explore Gemini's capabilities.
