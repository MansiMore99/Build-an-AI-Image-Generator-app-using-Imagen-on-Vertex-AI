### Project Overview:

Generative AI on **Vertex AI **(also known as genAI or gen AI) gives you access to Google's large generative AI models so you can test, tune, and deploy them for use in your AI-powered applications. In this lab, you will:

### ðŸš€ Features
- **Connect to Vertex AI (Google Cloud AI platform):** Learn how to establish a connection to Google's AI services using the Vertex AI SDK.
- **Load a pre-trained Image Generation Model:** Discover how to use a powerful, pre-trained AI model without building one from scratch.
- **Send text to the AI model:** Understand how to provide input for the AI to process.
- **Extract image-based answers from the AI:** Learn to handle and interpret the image responses generated by the AI model.
- **Understand the basics of building AI applications:** Gain insights into the core concepts of integrating AI into software projects.

### ðŸ§° Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Google Cloud project with Vertex AI enabled
- Installed SDKs:


### Setup:

**Step 1:**
Clone the Repo
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-image-generator.git
cd ai-image-generator
```

**Step 2:**
Copy the code into a file named GenerateImage.py.

**Step 3:**
Run it.
```
/usr/bin/python3 GenerateImage.py
```
âœ… This generates an image.jpeg file in the same directory.

**Step 4:**
To view the generated image
Open image.jpeg using your file explorer or any image viewer.

### Explanation:

- The code snippet is loading a pre-trained AI model called ImageGenerationModel (imagen-3.0-generate-002) on Vertex AI.
- The code calls the generate_image method of the loaded Gemini model.
- The input to the method is a text prompt.
- The code uses Gemini's ability to understand the text prompt and use it to build an AI Image.


### ðŸ“‚ Project Structure:

```
ai-image-generator/
â”œâ”€â”€ GenerateImage.py         # Main script
â”œâ”€â”€ image.jpeg               # Output file
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt         # Optional: Python deps
â””â”€â”€ samples/                 # Example generated images
```

Try it yourself! Experiment with different prompts to explore Gemini's capabilities.
